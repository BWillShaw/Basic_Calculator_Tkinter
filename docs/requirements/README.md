## Functional and Business requirements - Use and Purpose

Functional Requirements
Definition:
Functional requirements define the specific behavior or functions of a system. They describe what the system should do and include specifications of data to be input into the system, operations performed on these data, and the output of these operations. Functional requirements also describe interactions between the system and its environment or between different parts of the system.

Usage and Audience:
Used By: Primarily by the development and quality assurance (QA) teams.
Purpose: To provide a detailed specification that is a basis for designing, developing, and testing the software application.
Examples:
The software must allow the user to input text in a "Search" box.
The system must send an email confirmation after a user has made a booking.
Business Requirements
Definition:
Business requirements are high-level needs, goals, objectives, and outcomes to be fulfilled to achieve the strategic vision of an organization. These requirements focus less on the "how" and more on the "what" in terms of what needs to be achieved to meet the organizationâ€™s business strategy.

Usage and Audience:
Used By: Business stakeholders such as executives, managers, and product owners.
Purpose: To outline the motives behind the need for a particular project or system, providing a strong context to guide decision-making throughout development.
Examples:
The system should improve operational efficiency by 25%.
The product must capture at least 10% of the market share in the first year.

Differences and Why Both Are Required
How They Differ:
Scope: Functional requirements are much more detailed and are more about the 'how' of the process. Business requirements are high-level and focus on the 'what' and 'why'.
Audience: Business requirements are mainly for high-level business stakeholders who are concerned with the strategic vision. Functional requirements are for the people who are going to execute the project like developers, designers, and QA testers.
Detail: Business requirements are usually more generalized, while functional requirements are more specific and include detailed information on data, calculations, and flows.
Importance of Both:
Both types of requirements are critical to the success of a project for the following reasons:

Alignment with Business Goals: Business requirements ensure that the project aligns with the strategic goals and objectives of the business.
Project Execution: Functional requirements are essential for the actual creation of the product, as they lay down the functionalities that will fulfill the business objectives.
By having both documents, an organization can ensure that the developed system not only meets the practical or functional needs but also serves the larger business objectives.

Certainly! Below is an outline that describes the general steps, roles, and responsibilities in a simple to moderately complex software development project, using the example of building a basic calculator app. We'll also include a basic development timeline for this project.

## Software Development Steps, Roles, and Responsibilities

### Steps in Development Process

1. **Requirement Gathering and Analysis**
   - Collecting and understanding the project's functional and business requirements.

2. **Feasibility Study**
   - Assessing the feasibility of the project in terms of time, resources, and technology.

3. **System Design**
   - Creating architecture and design plans that include database and user interface designs.

4. **Implementation (Coding)**
   - Writing the code to make the application functional.

5. **Testing**
   - Testing the code to make sure it's free of errors, and that it meets all requirements.

6. **Deployment**
   - Deploying the code to a live environment for use.

7. **Maintenance**
   - Ongoing support and troubleshooting for the deployed application.
